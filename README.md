# k.aefa
Kwangwoon Automated Exploratory Factor Anlaysis (k.aefa): automatically find optimal number of factors with various exploratory factoring methods.
It supports traditional Classical True-score Theory based model approaches by dependes correlation only; ML, minres, wls, gls (from ```fa() in psych``` and ```efaUnrotate()``` in semTools), ADF (from ```FAiR```), Morden True-score Theory based model approaches; (Non-Compensatory) Full-information Exploratory IFA (from ```mirt``` and ```tam.fa()``` in TAM), Limited-information exploratory IFA using WLSMV estimation in Mplus7 (form ```efaUnrotate()``` in semTools). This project made and updated personal data analysis convinence since September 2013, but some imported packages requires the GPL 2 or GPL 3 licence. So I decided open this source code even skeleton code status; not a library. I'll improve this just a source code to library.
